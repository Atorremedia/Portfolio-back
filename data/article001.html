    <h3 >Learning fundamentals at the school and with friends</h3>
    <p >
        I was lucky enough, as a kid, to study some programming fundamentals at the school. Fortunately, I had some good computing teachers. They used to understand and enjoy what they taught and, to be honest, I could not say the same about all of my school teachers. It was the early 80's and computers were used mostly in professional environments, most of them were big and expensive. But there were some family computers starting to make their way. They were such a nerdy thing, mainly maid to play arcade games. My friends and I used to gather around a Commodore or Amstrad machine and we copied simple BASIC games from magazines. I remember enjoying much more when we dared to tweak the code and created our own versions of those games.
        Those days, while playing, I learned about <strong>sequential programming, loops, conditional statements, variables</strong> and other programming fundamentals. So many hours playing around with that simple code laid a thin but solid base for what was coming years after...

    <h3 >Early web design and development</h3>
    <p >
    In the 90's I was a teenager and personal computers started to bloom. I discovered Windows and started tinkering with design tools like <strong>CorelDraw</strong> and <strong>PhotoShop</strong>. The possibilities were endless and I had my first contact with design. It was fun and, when the web arrived, I stepped into <strong>Netscape Editor</strong> as a natural evolution in my digital discovery. And there I was, designing web pages and filling them all with GIFs right away. What a time!
    Internet was starting to be widely used. The web entered an exponential growth phase and we coud see it live.

    Then, I found <strong>Dreamweaver</strong>. It was a more sophisticated and professional GUI for web development, where I started to understand how HTML and CSS worked together and I learned that PHP was a thing.
    </p>
    <p >
    Things started to get fancy and then a different approach came out. Web pages offered new design and real dynamic features, not just GIFs wobling around. There was a new inspiring tool: <strong>Flash</strong>, a vectorial animation language that opened our minds and cluttered our machines and connection lines...
    </p>
    <p >
    After the Flash wave, <strong>CMSs</strong> came out and it was easy to pick any web template and adapt it as necessary. They offered lots of features, but, although many more possibilities were available in terms of design and functionality, that was never optimal for customization, not for web 1.0, even less for web 2.0. So I never got too enthusiastic about it. But my final dive into web development still had to wait a while.

    <h3 >Electronics and Microcontrollers</h3>
    <p > Time passed by and my next contact with code came because of a very different need. I have been a horse trainer for more than 25 years, now. And,  some years ago,  I designed a system for using positive reinforcement with horses, so they could have a better experience and learn more efficiently. With such an invention, the rider could press a button and then, a little device would deliver a small amount of a sweet jelly directly into the horse's mouth, on the go. I worked with some engineers and, after a long time and some money spent, I never got exactly what I needed, so I decided to learn electronics myself (something that was already interesting for me) and try to develop my project on my own. So I dived into microcontrollers and <strong>Arduino</strong> code, based on <strong>C++</strong>. This made me rediscover the joy of coding and, as I never lost contact with design (<strong>Adobe creative suite</strong> and even <strong>Blender</strong>), coding again would inevitably merge with it and lead me to web development once more...</p>
    <p > Coding again was such a good experience. I felt that power of creating what I imagined again, and it pushed me to learn more and more. From Arduino to Javascript, some graphic libraries, and then, to frontend development. But this time from a professional perspective.</p>
    <h3 >Digital interaction and Frontend development</h3>
    <p >I am currently studying a <strong>Degree in Digital Interaction and Multimedia</strong> in the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya and, for the last year, I have been studying frontend development on my own. This time, with a lot of dedication and following a good roadmap to become a professional software developer. I worked on web projects and took part in several events and challenges, like the <strong>Barcelona Cruz Roja Inclusive Coding Hackathon</strong>, organized by <a href="https://barcelonadigitaltalent.com" target="_blank" title="Barcelona Digital Talent">Barcelona Digital Talent</a> and <a href="https://nuwe.io" target="_blank" title="Nuwe.io">Nuwe</a>, where I finished in the first place with my team, last June.</p>
    <p >I use <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong> with <strong>React</strong>. And I keep expanding my knowledge about these tools and learning new ones, discovering new ways to implement design and code to make machines more useful to humans.</p>
